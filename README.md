# Re(flex) - Flex your reflexes
Re(flex) is a game that will test the users reflexes, but not in the conventional way. We are used to waiting for red light to turn green to press a button to measure our reflexes, but this game will measure your reflexes to let go of a key at a specified time. There is something psychologically different to pressing a key at a specified time versus letting go of a key at a specified time. 

This game will be for adults and children alike, and it will provide a fun game that helps sharpen your reflexes (and possibly flex them) to your family, friends and colleagues.

 - #### __Game Area__
   - This section will have a different colored background and contain the game itself.
   - It will provide a random number that is the goal of the game.
   - The counter will start as the user presses down a key and will stop once the user releases the key.
   - Once the user has released the key, the result is logged and a new randomly generated goal will be shown.
   - Dependant of the result (a margin of 0,2 seconds) will display the counter with a green background if user succeeds or a red background if the user doesn't succeed.<br>

#### function runTimer
- ```function runTimer() {
  var i = 0; // a counter which is displayed every 100ms

   // create interval which fires the callback every 100ms.
   // `interval` holds the interval ID, which is later used to clear the
   // interval (stop calling the callback)
  var interval = setInterval(function() { 

    text.innerHTML = i++; // write `i` and increment
    
    // if `i` is grater than 100 then clear the interval (stop calling the callback)
    if (i > 100) clearInterval(interval);
  }, 100);
